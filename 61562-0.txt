PREFACE.


_The first two of the children’s books here reproduced were published
in 1878; the last two in 1885, only a few weeks before_ Mr. CALDECOTT’S
_premature death. He had not intended to make any further additions
to their number, and the series is consequently complete. Into what
new domain his still-creative genius would have wandered,--for he
was well on the hither side of the period fixed by tradition for the
decline of human invention, and in spite of ill-health, was gifted
with a rare buoyancy and elasticity of temperament,--it is idle to
conjecture. But his gradual development from the tentative sketches of
his early days into the purely individual manner of his latest work,
had been unmistakeable enough to justify the belief that even higher
triumphs might have been reserved to his ripened powers. Would he not
have gained fresh laurels as a designer in some unfamiliar field?--as
a modeller of bas-relief touched with his own distinctive quality?--as
a delicate and dexterous water-colour artist? None can answer these
questions now. But at least he has left us a definite legacy of
accomplished work, for which we can scarcely be too grateful, since it
is unique in kind, and certain to be enduring in charm._

_Of this legacy, the two volumes of_ “Old Christmas” _and_ “Bracebridge
Hall,” _and the present collection of picture-books are surely
the most memorable. In decorating the gentle and kindly pages of_
Goldsmith’s _American disciple_, Mr. CALDECOTT _seems for the first
time to have discovered a fitting outlet of his cherished memories of
the country-side where he was bred, and of the picturesque old town
where he was born;--for those loving studies of animal life which had
delighted him as a boy;--for that feeling for the old-world in costume
and accessory which was a native impulse in his talent. No books of
this century have been so genially, so loyally, so sympathetically
illustrated. And yet these_ Irving _volumes, however excellent, were
but the stepping stones to the artist’s more signal successes in
nursery literature._ “John Gilpin” _and_ “The Mad Dog” _are illustrated
books; but they are illustrated books “with a difference.”_ Mr.
CALDECOTT _found in them his theme, it is true: but it was a theme upon
which his pencil played the most engaging variations. Who, for example,
ever before conceived of_ Madam Blaize _as a pawnbroker, because_--

  “_She freely lent to all the poor,--
      Who left a pledge behind_”?

_Who, again, had penetrated the hidden secret of that corroding
jealousy which led the dog to bite the prim and impeccable personage
who afterwards so fatally disagreed with him? And where else had the
world been shewn the authentic academic presence,--the very “form and
pressure,”--of_ “The Great Panjandrum Himself,” _“with the little
round button at top;” or imagined the hurly-burly of those headlong,
horn-blowing, cheek-bursting and hopelessly futile_ “Jovial Huntsmen”?
_Nor were these all, or even a tithe of the sportive surprises, the
undreamed disclosures, of these captivating pages. Around and about
them the artist has woven the most humourous ingenuities, the most
freakish and frolicsome fancies; he has set them in the most inviting
framework of town and country; he has enlisted in his service the most
blithe and winsome figures of women and children, the most irresistible
dogs and horses and birds. The open-air life of England, with all its
freshness and breeziness, its pastoral seduction and its picturesque
environment, is everywhere present in his work. He has the art, too,
of being elegant without being effeminate, and of being tender without
being mawkish. It was said of a great English novelist that his laugh
clears the air; it may be said of these light-hearted pictures that
their mirth clears not only the air but the imagination. No taint
clings to them of morbid affectation or sickly sentiment: they are the
genuine pictorial utterances of a manly, happy nature, delighting in
beauty, delighting in innocent pleasure, and dowered as few English
artists have been with the gifts of refinement and grace._

    THE DIVERTING HISTORY

THE DIVERTING HISTORY

OF

JOHN GILPIN:

_Showing how he went farther than he intended, and came safe home
again._

[Illustration: WRITTEN BY Wm. COWPER

WITH DRAWINGS BY R. CALDECOTT]

  John Gilpin was a citizen
    Of credit and renown,
  A train-band captain eke was he,
    Of famous London town.

  John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,
    “Though wedded we have been
  These twice ten tedious years, yet we
    No holiday have seen.

  “To-morrow is our wedding-day,
    And we will then repair
  Unto the ‘Bell’ at Edmonton,
    All in a chaise and pair.

  “My sister, and my sister’s child,
    Myself, and children three,
  Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
    On horseback after we.”

[Illustration: The Linendraper bold]

  He soon replied, “I do admire
    Of womankind but one,
  And you are she, my dearest dear,
    Therefore it shall be done.

  “I am a linendraper bold,
    As all the world doth know,
  And my good friend the calender
    Will lend his horse to go.”

  Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, “That’s well said;
    And for that wine is dear,
  We will be furnished with our own,
    Which is both bright and clear.”

  John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
    O’erjoyed was he to find,
  That though on pleasure she was bent,
    She had a frugal mind.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  The morning came, the chaise was brought,
    But yet was not allowed
  To drive up to the door, lest all
    Should say that she was proud.

  So three doors off the chaise was stayed,
    Where they all did get in;
  Six precious souls, and all agog
    To dash through thick and thin.

  Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
    Were never folks so glad!
  The stones did rattle underneath,
    As if Cheapside were mad.

  John Gilpin at his horse’s side
    Seized fast the flowing mane,
  And up he got, in haste to ride,
    But soon came down again;

  For saddletree scarce reached had he,
    His journey to begin,
  When, turning round his head, he saw
    Three customers come in.

  So down he came; for loss of time,
    Although it grieved him sore,
  Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
    Would trouble him much more.

[Illustration: The 3 customers]

[Illustration]

  ’Twas long before the customers
    Were suited to their mind,
  When Betty screaming came downstairs,
    “The wine is left behind!”

  “Good lack!” quoth he, “yet bring it me,
    My leathern belt likewise,
  In which I bear my trusty sword
    When I do exercise.”

  Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
    Had two stone bottles found,
  To hold the liquor that she loved,
    And keep it safe and sound.

  Each bottle had a curling ear,
    Through which the belt he drew,
  And hung a bottle on each side,
    To make his balance true.

  Then over all, that he might be
    Equipped from top to toe,
  His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,
    He manfully did throw.

  Now see him mounted once again
    Upon his nimble steed,
  Full slowly pacing o’er the stones,
    With caution and good heed.

[Illustration]

  But finding soon a smoother road
    Beneath his well-shod feet,
  The snorting beast began to trot,
    Which galled him in his seat.

[Illustration]

  “So, fair and softly!” John he cried,
    But John he cried in vain;
  That trot became a gallop soon,
    In spite of curb and rein.

  So stooping down, as needs he must
    Who cannot sit upright,
  He grasped the mane with both his hands,
    And eke with all his might.

  His horse, who never in that sort
    Had handled been before,
  What thing upon his back had got,
    Did wonder more and more.

  Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
    Away went hat and wig;
  He little dreamt, when he set out,
    Of running such a rig.

  The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
    Like streamer long and gay,
  Till, loop and button failing both,
    At last it flew away.

[Illustration]

  Then might all people well discern
    The bottles he had slung;
  A bottle swinging at each side,
    As hath been said or sung.

  The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
    Up flew the windows all;
  And every soul cried out, “Well done!”
    As loud as he could bawl.

  Away went Gilpin--who but he?
    His fame soon spread around;
  “He carries weight! he rides a race!
    ’Tis for a thousand pound!”

  And still as fast as he drew near,
    ’Twas wonderful to view
  How in a trice the turnpike-men
    Their gates wide open threw.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  And now, as he went bowing down
    His reeking head full low,
  The bottles twain behind his back
    Were shattered at a blow.

  Down ran the wine into the road,
    Most piteous to be seen,
  Which made the horse’s flanks to smoke,
    As they had basted been.

[Illustration]

  But still he seemed to carry weight,
    With leathern girdle braced;
  For all might see the bottle-necks
    Still dangling at his waist.

[Illustration]

  Thus all through merry Islington
    These gambols he did play,
  Until he came unto the Wash
    Of Edmonton so gay;

  And there he threw the wash about
    On both sides of the way,
  Just like unto a trundling mop,
    Or a wild goose at play.

[Illustration]

  At Edmonton his loving wife
    From the balcony spied
  Her tender husband, wondering much
    To see how he did ride.

  “Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here’s the house!”
    They all at once did cry;
  “The dinner waits, and we are tired;”
    Says Gilpin--“So am I!”

[Illustration]

  But yet his horse was not a whit
    Inclined to tarry there;
  For why?--his owner had a house
    Full ten miles off, at Ware.

  So like an arrow swift he flew.
    Shot by an archer strong;
  So he did fly--which brings me to
    The middle of my song.

[Illustration]

  Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
    And sore against his will,
  Till at his friend the calender’s
    His horse at last stood still.

  The calender, amazed to see
    His neighbour in such trim,
  Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
    And thus accosted him:

[Illustration]

  “What news? what news? your tidings tell;
    Tell me you must and shall--
  Say why bareheaded you are come,
    Or why you come at all?”

  Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
    And loved a timely joke;
  And thus unto the calender
    In merry guise he spoke:

  “I came because your horse would come:
    And, if I well forebode,
  My hat and wig will soon be here,
    They are upon the road.”

  The calender, right glad to find
    His friend in merry pin,
  Returned him not a single word,
    But to the house went in;

[Illustration]

  Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
    A wig that flowed behind,
  A hat not much the worse for wear,
    Each comely in its kind.

  He held them up, and in his turn
    Thus showed his ready wit:
  “My head is twice as big as yours,
    They therefore needs must fit.”

[Illustration]

  “But let me scrape the dirt away,
    That hangs upon your face;
  And stop and eat, for well you may
    Be in a hungry case.”

  Said John, “It is my wedding-day,
    And all the world would stare
  If wife should dine at Edmonton,
    And I should dine at Ware.”

  So turning to his horse, he said,
    “I am in haste to dine;
  ’Twas for your pleasure you came here,
    You shall go back for mine.”

  Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!
    For which he paid full dear;
  For while he spake, a braying ass
    Did sing most loud and clear;

  Whereat his horse did snort, as he
    Had heard a lion roar,
  And galloped off with all his might,
    As he had done before.

[Illustration]

  Away went Gilpin, and away
    Went Gilpin’s hat and wig;
  He lost them sooner than at first,
    For why?--they were too big.

[Illustration]

  Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
    Her husband posting down
  Into the country far away,
    She pulled out half-a-crown;

  And thus unto the youth she said
    That drove them to the “Bell,”
  “This shall be yours when you bring back
    My husband safe and well.”

[Illustration]

  The youth did ride, and soon did meet
    John coming back amain;
  Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
    By catching at his rein.

  But not performing what he meant,
    And gladly would have done,
  The frighted steed he frighted more,
    And made him faster run.

  Away went Gilpin, and away
    Went postboy at his heels,
  The postboy’s horse right glad to miss
    The lumbering of the wheels.

[Illustration]

  Six gentlemen upon the road,
    Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
  With postboy scampering in the rear,
    They raised the hue and cry.

  “Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!”
    Not one of them was mute;
  And all and each that passed that way
    Did join in the pursuit.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  And now the turnpike-gates again
    Flew open in short space;
  the toll-men thinking, as before,
    That Gilpin rode a race.

  And so he did, and won it too,
    For he got first to town;
  Nor stopped till where he had got up,
    He did again get down.

  Now let us sing, Long live the King,
    And Gilpin, long live he;
  And when he next doth ride abroad,
    May I be there to see.

[Illustration]

  In Islington there lived a man,
    Of whom the world might say,
  That still a godly race he ran,

[Illustration]

  Whene’er he went

[Illustration]

  to pray.

[Illustration]

  A kind and gentle heart he had,
      To comfort friends and foes;
  The naked every day he clad,

[Illustration]

  When he put on

[Illustration]

  his clothes.

[Illustration]

  And in that town a dog was found:
      As many dogs there be----
  Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
    And curs of low degree.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  This dog and man at first were friends;

[Illustration]

  But, when a pique began,

[Illustration]

  The dog, to gain some private ends,
  Went mad, and bit the man.

THE BABES IN THE WOOD.

[Illustration: SORE SICKE THEY WERE AND LIKE TO DYE]

[Illustration]

  Now ponder well, you parents deare,
      These wordes which I shall write;
  A doleful story you shall heare,
      In time brought forth to light.

  A gentleman of good account
      In Norfolke dwelt of late,
  Who did in honour far surmount
      Most men of his estate.

  Sore sicke he was, and like to dye,
      No helpe his life could save;
  His wife by him as sicke did lye,
      And both possest one grave.

[Illustration]

  No love between these two was lost,
      Each was to other kinde;
  In love they liv’d, in love they dyed,
      And left two babes behinde:

  The one a fine and pretty boy,
      Not passing three yeares olde;
  The other a girl more young than he,
      And fram’d in beautye’s molde.

  The father left his little son,
      As plainlye doth appeare,
  When he to perfect age should come,
      Three hundred poundes a yeare.

  And to his little daughter Jane
      Five hundred poundes in gold,
  To be paid downe on marriage-day,
      Which might not be controll’d:

[Illustration]

  But if the children chanced to dye,
      Ere they to age should come,
  Their uncle should possesse their wealth;
      For so the wille did run.

[Illustration: Now, BROTHER, said the dying man, LOOK TO MY CHILDREN
DEARE.]

  “Now, brother,” said the dying man,
      “Look to my children deare;
  Be good unto my boy and girl,
      No friendes else have they here:

  “To God and you I do commend
      My children deare this daye;
  But little while be sure we have
      Within this world to staye.

  “You must be father and mother both,
      And uncle all in one;
  God knowes what will become of them,
      When I am dead and gone.”

[Illustration]

  With that bespake their mother deare:
      “O brother kinde,” quoth shee,
  “You are the man must bring our babes
      To wealth or miserie:

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  “And if you keep them carefully,
      Then God will you reward;
  But if you otherwise should deal,
      God will your deedes regard.”

[Illustration: WITH LIPPES AS COLD AS ANY STONE, THEY KIST THE CHILDREN
SMALL]

  With lippes as cold as any stone,
      They kist the children small:
  “God bless you both, my children deare;”
      With that the teares did fall.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  These speeches then their brother spake
      To this sicke couple there:
  “The keeping of your little ones,
      Sweet sister, do not feare:

  “God never prosper me nor mine,
      Nor aught else that I have,
  If I do wrong your children deare,
      When you are layd in grave.”

[Illustration]

[Illustration: THEIR PARENTS BEING DEAD & GONE, THE CHILDREN HOME HE
TAKES.]

  The parents being dead and gone,
      The children home he takes,
  And bringes them straite unto his house,
      Where much of them he makes.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  He had not kept these pretty babes
      A twelvemonth and a daye,
  But, for their wealth, he did devise
      To make them both awaye.

  He bargain’d with two ruffians strong,
      Which were of furious mood,
  That they should take the children young,
      And slaye them in a wood.

[Illustration]

  He told his wife an artful tale,
      He would the children send
  To be brought up in faire London,
      With one that was his friend.

[Illustration]

  Away then went those pretty babes,
      Rejoycing at that tide,
  Rejoycing with a merry minde,
      They should on cock-horse ride.

[Illustration: AWAY THEN WENT THE PRETTY BABES REJOYCING AT THAT TIDE]

[Illustration]

  They prate and prattle pleasantly
      As they rode on the waye,
  To those that should their butchers be,
      And work their lives’ decaye:

  So that the pretty speeche they had,
      Made murderers’ heart relent;
  And they that undertooke the deed,
      Full sore did now repent.

  Yet one of them, more hard of heart,
      Did vow to do his charge,
  Because the wretch, that hired him,
      Had paid him very large.

[Illustration]

  The other would not agree thereto,
      So here they fell to strife;
  With one another they did fight,
      About the children’s life:

[Illustration]

  And he that was of mildest mood
      Did slaye the other there,
  Within an unfrequented wood,
      Where babes did quake for feare!

[Illustration: AND HE THAT WAS OF MILDEST MOOD

DID SLAYE THE OTHER THERE]

[Illustration]

  He took the children by the hand,
      While teares stood in their eye,
  And bade them come and go with him,
      And look they did not crye:

  And two long miles he ledd them on,
      While they for food complaine:
  “Stay here,” quoth he, “I’ll bring ye bread,
      When I come back againe.”

[Illustration]

  These prettye babes, with hand in hand,
      Went wandering up and downe;

[Illustration]

  But never more they sawe the man
      Approaching from the town.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Their prettye lippes with blackberries
      Were all besmear’d and dyed;

  And when they sawe the darksome night,
      They sat them downe and cryed.

[Illustration]

  Thus wandered these two prettye babes,
      Till death did end their grief;
  In one another’s armes they dyed,
      As babes wanting relief.

  No burial these prettye babes
      Of any man receives,

[Illustration]

  Till Robin-redbreast painfully
      Did cover them with leaves.

  It’s of three jovial huntsmen, an’ a hunting they did go;
  An’ they hunted, an’ they hollo’d, an’ they blew their horns also.
                                      Look ye there!

[Illustration]

  An’ one said, “Mind yo’r e’en, an’ keep yo’r noses reet i’ th’ wind.

  An’ then, by scent or seet, we’ll leet o’ summat to our mind.”
                                          Look ye there!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  They hunted, an’ they hollo’d, an’ the first thing they did find
  Was a tatter’t boggart, in a field, an’ that they left behind.
                          Look ye there!

  One said it was a boggart, an’ another he said “Nay;
  It’s just a ge’man-farmer, that has gone an’ lost his way.”
                          Look ye there!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                                      Look ye there!

  One said it was a grindlestone, another he said “Nay;
  It’s nought but an’ owd fossil cheese, that somebody’s roll’t away.”

  One said it was a bull-calf, an’ another he said “Nay;

[Illustration]

  They hunted, an’ they hollo’d, an’ the next thing they did find
  Was a two-three children leaving school, an’ these they left behind.
                                      Look ye there!

  One said that they were children, but another he said “Nay;
  They’re no’ but little angels, so we’ll leave ’em to their play.”
                                      Look ye there!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  They hunted, an’ they hollo’d, an’ the next thing they did find

                                      Look ye there!

  One said it was a fat pig, but another he said “Nay;
  It’s just a Lunnon Alderman, whose clothes are stole away.”

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  They hunted, an’ they hollo’d, an’ the next thing they did find

  One said that they were lovers, but another he said “Nay;

  So they hunted, an’ they hollo’d, till the setting of the sun;
  An’ they’d nought to bring away at last, when th’ huntin’-day was done.
                                      Look ye there!

  Then one unto the other said, “This huntin’ doesn’t pay;
  But we’n powler’t up an’ down a bit, an’ had a rattlin’ day.”
                                      Look ye there!

A FROG HE WOULD A-WOOING GO.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  A FROG he would a-wooing go,
            _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  Whether his Mother would let him or no.
          _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
            _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  So off he set with his opera-hat,
            _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  And on his way he met with a Rat.
          _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
            _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY.

[Illustration]

  “Pray, Mr. RAT, will you go with me,”
            _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  “Pretty Miss MOUSEY for to see?”
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Now they soon arrived at MOUSEY’S Hall,
            _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  And gave a loud knock, and gave a loud call.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  “Pray, Miss MOUSEY, are you within?”
            _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  “Oh, yes, kind Sirs, I’m sitting to spin.”

  _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
            _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  “Pray, Miss Mouse, will you give us some beer?”
                    _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  “For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer.”

[Illustration]

  _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_

[Illustration]

  _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  “Pray, Mr. FROG, will you give us a song?”
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  “But let it be something that’s not very long.”
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  “Indeed, Miss MOUSE,” replied Mr. FROG,
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  “A cold has made me as hoarse as a Hog.”
            _With a rowley-powley, Gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  “Since you have caught cold,” Miss MOUSEY said,
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  “I’ll sing you a song that I have just made.”
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  But while they were all thus a merry-making,
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  A Cat and her Kittens came tumbling in.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  The Cat she seized the Rat by the crown;
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  The Kittens they pulled the little Mouse down.
                  _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  This put Mr. FROG in a terrible fright;
                          _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  He took up his hat, and he wished them good night.
                  _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                        _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  But as Froggy was crossing a silvery brook,
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  A lily-white Duck came and gobbled him up.
                  _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  So there was an end of one, two, and three,
                      _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
  The Rat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-gee!
                  _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                      _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

  Good people all, with one accord,
  Lament for Madam Blaize,
  Who never wanted a good word----

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _From those_

[Illustration]

  _who spoke her praise._

[Illustration]

  The needy seldom pass’d her door,
      And always found her kind;
  She freely lent to all the poor----

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _Who left_

[Illustration]

  _a pledge behind._

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  She strove the neighbourhood to please
      With manners wondrous winning;

  And never follow’d wicked ways----

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _Unless when she was sinning._

[Illustration]

  At church, in silks and satins new,
      With hoop of monstrous size,
  She never slumber’d in her pew----

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _But when she shut her eyes._

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Her love was sought, I do aver,
      By twenty beaux and more;
  The King himself has follow’d her--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _When she has walk’d before._

[Illustration]

  But now, her wealth and finery fled,
    Her hangers-on cut short-all:
  The Doctors found, when she was dead--
    _Her last disorder mortal._

[Illustration]

  Let us lament, in sorrow sore,
    For Kent Street well may say,
  That had she lived a twelvemonth more,--
    _She had not died to-day._

Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation, hyphenation, unbalanced or missing quotation marks, and
spelling were not changed.

Simple typographical errors were corrected.

Text within illustrations is shown here as captions.

The book is a collection of four other books. The illustrations include
the covers of those books, and some of those covers include the names
of the stories within them. Those names are not necessarily in the
sequence in which the stories appear.

When it was unclear whether multiple lines of verse were split because
of lack of space or because they were separate verses, the splits have
been retained.
